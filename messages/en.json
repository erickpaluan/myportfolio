    "about": "<p>Hello! I’m Erick Paluan, a graduate in Information Systems, specialized at the intersection of design and code.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, I’ve mastered two fields that rarely talk to each other: I’ve created visual identities, finalized materials for offset printing, and designed digital interfaces. But I didn’t stop at Figma.</p><p>I learned how to code to turn prototypes into real products. I built the IT department at CEARP, developed systems in production, and discovered that my greatest strength lies exactly where design and development meet.</p><p>Today, I build fullstack applications using React, Node.js, and TypeScript, always with the mindset of someone who deeply understands UX. I don’t need a translator between design and dev — I speak both languages.</p><p>If you’re looking for someone who:<br>- Designs intuitive interfaces and implements them<br>- Understands code architecture and design systems<br>- Can communicate seamlessly with both designers and engineers<br>- Delivers products, not just screens or lines of code</p><p>Then let’s talk.</p>"
